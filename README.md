#Welcome to the Sesame code repository#

Sesame is an extensible Java framework for storing, querying and inferencing for RDF. It can be deployed as a web server or used as a Java library. Features include several query languages (SeRQL and SPARQL), inferencing support, and RAM, disk, or RDBMS storage. Additionally, the central APIs of Sesame are storage-independent and are supported by many third-party RDF database vendors.

Report any issues in the [OpenRDF JIRA issue tracker](https://openrdf.atlassian.net/). 

More information about Sesame can be found at [openRDF.org](http://www.openrdf.org/).
