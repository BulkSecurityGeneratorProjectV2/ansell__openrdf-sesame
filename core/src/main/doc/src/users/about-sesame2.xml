		<para>
			Sesame is an open source Java framework for storage and querying of
			RDF data. The framework is fully extensible and configurable with
			respect to storage mechanisms, inferencers, RDF file formats, query
			result formats and query languages. Sesame offers a JBDC-like user
			API, streamlined system APIs and a RESTful HTTP interface supporting
			the SPARQL Protocol for RDF.
		</para>
		<para>
			Of course, a framework isn't very useful without implementations of
			the various APIs. Out of the box, Sesame supports SPARQL and SeRQL
			querying, a memory-based and a disk-based RDF store and RDF Schema
			inferencers. It also supports most popular RDF file formats and
			query result formats. Various extensions are available or are being
			worked at elsewhere.

			Originally, Sesame was developed by
			<ulink url="http://www.aduna-software.com/">Aduna</ulink> (then
			known as Aidministrator) as a research prototype for the hugely
			successful EU research project
			<ulink url="http://www.ontoknowledge.org/">On-To-Knowledge</ulink>.
			When this work ended in 2001, Aduna continued the development in
			cooperation with <ulink url="http://www.nlnet.nl/">NLnet Foundation</ulink>,
			developers from <ulink url="">Ontotext</ulink>, and a number of volunteer developers who
			contribute ideas, bug reports and fixes.
		</para>
		<para>
			Sesame is currently developed as a community project, with Aduna as
			the project leader. Community support is available from
			<ulink url="http://www.openrdf.org/">www.openrdf.org</ulink>. Aduna
			also offers commercial support and consultency services, feel free
			to <ulink url="http://www.aduna-software.com/contact/">contact
